This repo is an attempt to make the model generate meaningful Arabic text and expirement with gpt2 model. 
Unfortunately the only readily available text files to feed the model were the Bible and Quran, which lead to the generation of text that seem old and meaningless.
The next step is to use some webscraping techniques and maybe use the already translated text from wikipedia and other Arabic journals.
